# mana
Mana is an MCP server that doubles your Claude Code usage!  It filters tool output bloat — file reads, bash outputs, directory searches — routing through lightweight models, extending your usage limits and keeping your context lean. Your prompts and Claude's responses stay untouched. Same workflow, 2x the mana.
